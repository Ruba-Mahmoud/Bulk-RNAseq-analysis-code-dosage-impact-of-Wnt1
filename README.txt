This repository contains a shell and R script used for conducting Bulk RNAseq analysis  for our publication comparing 
P0Wnt1 versus P0Control and P14Wnt1 versus P14Control samples.
The analysis begins with shell script before continuing to R script, and same code was used 
for P0Wnt1 vs P0Control and P14Wnt1 vs P14Control. For P0Wnt1 vs P0Control we used Deseq2 
additive model to include the batch effect, meamwhile in P14Wnt1 vs P14Control we used Deseq2 simple mode.
